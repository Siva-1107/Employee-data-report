This project focuses on analyzing employee salary structures and departmental profitability of a sample data set from Kaggle using visual analytics. The dashboard compares average monthly salaries across employee classes and departments, alongside profit and variance metrics. Using multiple charts, this project highlights key insights such as which departments generate the highest profit, how salary distribution varies across roles, and which departments contribute most to financial variance. The analysis supports data-driven decision-making in workforce planning, budgeting, and performance evaluation.
